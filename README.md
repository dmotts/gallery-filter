# Gallery Filter

## Project Overview
Gallery Filter is a simple image gallery filter application built using Vue.js. The application allows users to filter images by hashtags, making it easier to view specific images in the gallery. The project leverages Vue.js for the front-end functionality, Express.js for the backend, and EJS as the templating engine.

## Features
- Display a gallery of images with associated hashtags.
- Filter images by hashtags in real time.
- Vue.js frontend for dynamic updates without page refresh.
- Express.js backend with EJS templating for server-side rendering.
- Simple and responsive design using Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used
- **[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/):** A progressive JavaScript framework used for building dynamic user interfaces and handling the gallery filter functionality.
- **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/):** A lightweight web framework for Node.js used to handle server-side logic and routing.
- **[EJS](https://ejs.co/):** A templating engine for generating HTML with embedded JavaScript, used for rendering views on the server.
- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/):** A popular CSS framework for creating responsive and mobile-first web designs.
- **[Lodash](https://lodash.com/):** A utility library providing helpful functions for common programming tasks, used in the Vue.js component for filtering.
- **[JQuery](https://jquery.com/):** A fast and lightweight JavaScript library used for simplifying DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/):** JavaScript runtime used to execute server-side code for the application.
